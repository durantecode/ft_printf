# ft_printf - Replicate printf function in C#

## This is my ft_printf project for 42-Cursus Madrid 2021 ##

Here we are asked to replicate de printf function for the following specifiers: **"cspdiuxX%"** 
and flags: **"0.-*"**

This project introduces us the "variable arguments", which is essential for this project as you never know how many arguments your function is going to get.
It was quite tricky to understand the work-around, but once you get it, it becomes really useful.

The most challenging part for me in this project was to replicate the flags "width" and "precission" of the original printf. As they work quite different
between "char" "string" "int"... etc.

It passes all tests for the following testers (Use them only as a reference):
 
✅  [printfTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester) \
✅  [PFT](https://github.com/gavinfielder/pft) \
✅  [ft_printf_test](https://github.com/cacharle/ft_printf_test) 

- **Status:** *Finished*
- **Result:** *100/100 by moulinette*
